### Style changes

This blog theme is been built using a CSS pre-processor called SCSS. Any changes has to be inside of SCSS file structure located in `assets/style/scss` then exported to CSS using the following command:

```console
sass ./assets/style/scss/main.scss ./assets/style/main.min.css --style compressed
```

if you need to do constantly changes i higly recommend to use the `--watch` parameter to keep the code running for each style change:

```console
sass --watch ./assets/style/scss/main.scss ./assets/style/main.min.css --style compressed
```
